<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These peanuts are best made as gifts, unless you plan on eating the whole darn recipe in one sitting, they're that good.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li>2 cups raw peanuts (skin on or off)</li>
<li>1 cup white sugar</li>
<li>1/3 cup water</li>
<li>Salt and spices (Korean red pepper flakes, pumpkin spice, Ethiopian berbere...) to taste</li></ul>
<h2>Directions</h2><ol>
    <li>In a heavy cast iron skillet mix the peanuts, sugar and water</li>
    <li>Stir til the sugar gets sandy and dry.</li>
    <li>Lower the heat and keep cooking as the sugar eventually melts and turns to syrup.</li>
    <li>When the peanuts are brown (but before anything burns!) add a sprinkling of salt and the spices desired, and then dump peanut mixture out of the pan onto a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Let the peanuts cool completely, break up clumps, and store in an airtight container. Keeps for up to one week.</li>
</ol>
